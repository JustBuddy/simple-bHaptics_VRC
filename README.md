# simple-bHaptics_VRC
Simple VRCFury-based contact prefab for the X40 Tactsuit  
  
**Requires only VRCFury**  
Uses this program as bridge, which I found to be more stable than the current one:

**Setup**  
Just add the prefab to your avatar, adjust the contact positions to your body, build!  

Currently only supports the Suit itself, since I don't own any other pieces.  
Feel free to contribute the other points.
